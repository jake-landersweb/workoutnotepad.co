## Information Sharing

SapphireNW respects your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information. We do not share, sell, rent, or otherwise disclose your personal information to any third parties for their marketing or other purposes without your explicit consent.

There are, however, circumstances under which your information may be disclosed:

- **Legal Requirements and Law Enforcement**: We may disclose your personal information if required by law, regulation, legal process, or a governmental request. We may also share your information if we believe it's necessary to detect, prevent, or address illegal activity, fraud, or threats to the security of our app or the rights, property, or personal safety of us, our users, or others.

Please know that we will always strive to ensure that any such disclosures are made in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

## Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Our services do not use cookies at this time. But, this is subject to change and by using our product you agree to the fact that cookies may be implemented in the future for web-related features.

These cookies will strictly be used to provide a better user experience, and not to track or sell to advertisers.

## Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as necessary to provide you with our services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

When you request to delete your account, we will remove all your personal information, including your email, phone number, and uploaded images and videos, from our systems. Please note, however, that certain information will be retained even after account deletion. This includes:

- **Purchase Information**: If you have made any purchases in our app, the transaction history will remain.
- **App Usage Statuses**: We keep records of app usage data to help improve our services, ensure optimal performance, and detect any technical issues or discrepancies.

Please be aware that even after your request for deletion, some copies of your information may remain in our system if necessary for legal, safety, or compliance reasons.

We commit to deleting or de-identifying personal information once it is no longer required, in accordance with our data retention policies and applicable laws and regulations.

## Security Measures

In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures, but remember that no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

We are committed to protecting your personal information and have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to safeguard your data. These measures are designed to prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure of your information.

However, while we strive to protect your personal information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot promise or guarantee absolute security.

We do not store passwords, and we strongly advise that you refrain from sending us sensitive information, as any other data is stored unencrypted. In case of a security breach, we will inform the relevant users and authorities as required by law.

Remember, the transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

## User Rights

Your existing "User Rights" section seems comprehensive, however, you may want to update it to include recent data protection regulations (like GDPR and CCPA), if applicable, and tailor the rights according to the data you're processing. Here's a revised version:

**User Rights**

In Short: Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict its use. You may also have the right to object to how we use your data and to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

- **Data Access, Correction, and Deletion**: Depending on your location, you may have the right to request access to your personal data, have your data corrected, or have it deleted. However, these rights are not absolute, and we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use, or comply with legal requirements.
- **Objection and Restriction of Processing**: In some jurisdictions, you may have the right to object to our processing of your personal data or to restrict such processing.

## International Data Transfers

Currently, all user data collected through our app is stored within the United States on Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers. AWS maintains a high standard of security and is compliant with several recognized certifications and regulations.

However, please be aware that this is subject to change and that in the future we may need to transfer your data to servers outside the United States. If this becomes necessary, we will update this privacy policy accordingly and take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable data protection laws.

We commit to taking appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this privacy policy when it is transferred internationally.

## Children's Privacy

Our app is designed for users of all ages, and we are committed to protecting the privacy of children who use our app. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without obtaining parental consent.

If you are under 13, please do not provide any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under 13 without parental consent, please contact us immediately at jake@workoutnotepad.co

For users based in the European Union, the data protection law provides different protections, and we do not collect personal information from any users without parental consent if they are under the age of 16.

Parents and guardians can review, edit, request the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's personal information or make inquiries regarding this policy by contacting us at jake@workoutnotepad.co

We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g. backups, etc.).

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time. If we make significant changes to this policy, we will notify you through an in-app notification, an email to the address we have on file for you, or through other reasonable means. The notification will occur prior to the changes taking effect and we will update the 'Last updated' date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about our collection, processing, and sharing of your personal information. Your continued use of our app after the effective date of any update to the Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of the updated policy.
